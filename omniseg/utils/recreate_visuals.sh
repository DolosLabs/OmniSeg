#           Visualize All Trained Models
#
# This script automatically finds the best checkpoint for each training run,
# extracts the backbone name from the directory path, and runs the
# visualize_model.py script.
# ==============================================================================

# --- Configuration ---
# Set the base directory containing all your training run folders.
# The script will search for subdirectories like 'dino_sparrow_seg_128',
# 'repvgg_maskrcnn_128', etc., inside this path.
