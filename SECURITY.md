## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in OmniSeg, please report it by following these steps:

### For Security Issues

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email us directly at: [security contact - replace with actual email]
3. Include the following information in your report:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the vulnerability within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical vulnerabilities will be patched within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate responsible disclosure with you

### Scope

This security policy applies to:
- The main OmniSeg codebase
- All dependencies listed in requirements.txt
- Docker containers and deployment configurations
- Documentation that could lead to security issues

### Out of Scope

The following are typically out of scope:
- Issues in dependencies that are already publicly known
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks
- Denial of service attacks

## Security Best Practices

When using OmniSeg:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update all dependencies
2. **Secure Model Storage**: Store trained models in secure locations
3. **Validate Inputs**: Always validate and sanitize input data
4. **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets or API keys
5. **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls for production deployments

## Security Features

OmniSeg includes several security features:

- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure temporary file handling
- Safe pickle alternatives for model serialization
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static security analysis

## Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not have a formal bug bounty program, but we appreciate security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

## Security Testing

We use the following tools and practices for security:

- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Semgrep**: Static analysis security testing
- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis
- **Dependency Review**: Automated dependency vulnerability checks
