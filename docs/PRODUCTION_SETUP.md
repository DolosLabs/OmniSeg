# Production-Ready OmniSeg: Testing and Security Setup

This document provides comprehensive information about the production-ready testing and security infrastructure added to OmniSeg.

## 🧪 Testing Infrastructure

### Test Framework Setup
- **pytest**: Comprehensive testing framework with fixtures and markers
- **pytest-cov**: Code coverage analysis
- **pytest-mock**: Mocking and test doubles
- **pytest-timeout**: Test timeout management
- **pytest-benchmark**: Performance benchmarking

### Test Organization

```
tests/
├── conftest.py              # Global fixtures and configuration
├── test_config.py           # Configuration module tests
├── test_backbones.py        # Backbone model tests
├── test_heads.py            # Head model tests
├── test_integration.py      # End-to-end integration tests
├── test_performance.py      # Performance and benchmark tests
├── test_security.py         # Security vulnerability tests
└── quick_model_test.py      # Existing model compatibility tests
```

### Test Categories

Tests are organized with pytest markers:

- `@pytest.mark.unit`: Fast unit tests for individual components
- `@pytest.mark.integration`: Integration tests for component interaction
- `@pytest.mark.security`: Security vulnerability tests
- `@pytest.mark.slow`: Tests that take longer to run
- `@pytest.mark.model`: Tests requiring model downloads
- `@pytest.mark.benchmark`: Performance benchmark tests

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test categories
pytest -m unit                    # Fast unit tests only
pytest -m "not slow"              # Skip slow tests
pytest -m security                # Security tests only
pytest -m integration             # Integration tests only

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=omniseg --cov-report=html

# Run performance benchmarks
pytest --benchmark-only
```

## 🔒 Security Infrastructure

### Security Scanning Tools

1. **Bandit**: Python security linter
   - Detects common security issues in Python code
   - Configured in `pyproject.toml`

2. **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanner
   - Checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
   - Runs in CI/CD pipeline

3. **Semgrep**: Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
   - Advanced code analysis for security patterns
   - Integrated with GitHub Security tab

4. **Detect-secrets**: Secrets detection
   - Prevents accidental commit of secrets
   - Baseline configuration in `.secrets.baseline`

### Security Tests

Custom security tests include:
- Hardcoded secrets detection
- Dangerous function usage (eval, exec)
- Input validation testing
- Shell injection prevention
- Pickle usage detection
- Environment variable validation
- File permission checks
- Debug mode detection

### Security Configuration

- `SECURITY.md`: Security policy and reporting guidelines
- `.secrets.baseline`: Baseline for secrets detection
- Security-focused pre-commit hooks

## 📋 Code Quality Standards

### Pre-commit Hooks

Automated quality checks on every commit:
- **Black**: Code formatting
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **flake8**: Linting and style checks
- **mypy**: Type checking
- **bandit**: Security scanning
- **detect-secrets**: Secrets detection

Setup:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Code Quality Tools

1. **Black**: Consistent code formatting
2. **isort**: Import organization
3. **flake8**: Linting and style enforcement
4. **mypy**: Static type checking

Configuration in `pyproject.toml`

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflows

#### Comprehensive Testing (`comprehensive-testing.yml`)
- **Code Quality**: Black, isort, flake8, mypy
- **Security Scanning**: Bandit, Safety, Semgrep
- **Unit Tests**: Multi-OS, multi-Python version matrix
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end functionality
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking and profiling
- **Security Tests**: Custom security vulnerability tests
- **Documentation**: Automated docs building

#### Enhanced Features
- **Dependency Caching**: Faster CI runs
- **Artifact Upload**: Test results and reports
- **Coverage Reporting**: Codecov integration
- **PR Comments**: Automated test result summaries
- **Scheduled Scans**: Weekly security audits

### CI/CD Matrix Testing

Tests run across:
- **Operating Systems**: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- **Python Versions**: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- **Test Categories**: Unit, integration, security, performance

## 📊 Coverage and Reporting

### Code Coverage
- Minimum coverage threshold: 70%
- HTML reports in `htmlcov/`
- XML reports for CI integration
- Coverage exclusions for test files and boilerplate

### Test Reports
- JUnit XML for CI integration
- HTML coverage reports
- Performance benchmark results
- Security scan reports

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### Core Configuration
- `pyproject.toml`: Central configuration for all tools
- `requirements-dev.txt`: Development dependencies
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Pre-commit hook configuration

### Testing Configuration
- `conftest.py`: Pytest fixtures and global configuration
- Test markers and timeout settings
- Coverage configuration and exclusions

### Security Configuration
- `SECURITY.md`: Security policy
- `.secrets.baseline`: Secrets detection baseline
- Bandit security settings

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

### Benchmark Tests
- Model inference speed
- Memory usage during training
- Batch size scaling performance
- Image size scaling analysis
- Cross-platform performance comparison

### Memory Profiling
- Training memory usage tracking
- Memory leak detection
- Resource cleanup validation

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. Install development dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
2. Set up pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`
3. Run tests before committing: `pytest -m "not slow"`
4. Check security: `pytest -m security`

### Pull Request Process
1. All tests must pass
2. Code coverage must meet threshold
3. Security scans must pass
4. Pre-commit hooks must pass
5. Performance regression checks

## 📖 Best Practices

### Writing Tests
- Use descriptive test names
- Include docstrings for test classes and methods
- Use appropriate markers (@pytest.mark.unit, etc.)
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and failure cases

### Security Practices
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Validate all inputs
- Use secure file operations
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Regular dependency updates

### Performance Considerations
- Profile critical paths
- Monitor memory usage
- Benchmark model inference
- Test with various batch sizes
- Consider device compatibility

## 🚨 Security Incident Response

1. **Report**: Use security contact in SECURITY.md
2. **Assessment**: Security team evaluates severity
3. **Patch**: Develop and test fix
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinate responsible disclosure
5. **Follow-up**: Post-incident review and improvements
